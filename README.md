# TN HB 1614 Example

This repository is meant as an example of how poorly worded [TN HB 1614](https://legiscan.com/TN/text/HB1614/2023) is.

Basically, the bill does not define "data" meaningfully. 
Therefore, the example site here has an infinite data source,
providing infinitely more data than the actual content of the site.
Instead of actual content the bill refers to, this site simply uses a picture of a cat. 
After all, the internet was made for cats.
